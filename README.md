# GDenAI
 code to expirence with GenAI for IP networking tech

 The code is a Python script that sets up a web application using Flask to interact with a network management system, specifically Network Services Orchestrator (NSO). The script includes several components and functionalities:
 
Environment Setup: It uses environment variables for configuration, including authentication details, which are loaded using the dotenv package.
Logging: The script sets up logging to capture information and errors, outputting logs to standard output.
Network Interaction:
Utilizes the ncs library to interact with network devices managed by NSO.
Defines functions to execute various network commands, such as retrieving router configurations, interface statuses, and other operational data.
Agent Setup:
Implements a ReActAgent using tools that represent network operations (like getting router versions, configurations, and executing commands).
Functions are wrapped using FunctionTool to integrate into the agent's capabilities.
Flask Application:
Provides a web interface where users can submit queries to the agent.
Includes a form for submitting queries and a button to reset the agent.
The application runs with SSL for secure connections.
Utilities:
Functions are provided for managing LLM (Language Learning Model) initialization and reinitialization.
Includes a utility to fetch device configurations from the NSO via REST API, using basic authentication.
Example Operations:
Multiplication and addition functions are defined as examples of using the FunctionTool.
Network operations such as ping, traceroute, and configuration rollbacks are also implemented.
 
Key Sections:
 
Environment and Authentication: Handles secure storage of credentials and API endpoints.
Agent and Tool Definition: Sets up tools for interacting with network devices and defines how the agent processes requests.
Flask Interface: Provides a web-based interface for user interaction with the agent.
Network Command Execution: Offers a range of functions to execute commands on network devices.
 
Usage:
 
Deploy the Flask app to allow network administrators to interact with network devices through a secure web interface.
Use the defined functions and tools to automate network management tasks and query devices for specific information.
